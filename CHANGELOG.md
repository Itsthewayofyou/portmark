# Changelog

All notable changes to Portmark are recorded here. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-01

The first release with usable content. `0.1.0` reserved the name and predates every feature below.

### Added

- **`portmark keygen`** — mints an Ed25519 signing key together with the trust registry a host
  needs to accept it. The two halves are emitted at once because a private key whose public half
  was never published is unusable.
- **`portmark envelope`** — builds and signs an agent envelope from a JSON spec and prints a
  ready-to-POST `message/send` request. Constructs no host: the signing key belongs to whoever
  sends the agent, and the host only verifies. Unknown spec fields are rejected rather than
  ignored. Sending an agent is now three commands and no Python.
- **`--tools module:function`** — install your own `ToolRegistry` instead of the demo stubs.
  Refuses to start without `--policy-path`, because host policy is a hard ceiling and a tool the
  policy does not grant would be silently dropped from the effective permit. See `TOOLS.md`.
- **URL argument constraints** — `scheme`, `allowed_schemes`, `allowed_hosts`, `allowed_domains`,
  enforced host-side through the permit rather than inside the tool, with userinfo and
  trailing-dot handling.
- **Container support** — a `Dockerfile` running non-root against `portmark.asgi:app`, plus
  `GET /healthz` and `GET /readyz`. `serve()` still refuses non-loopback binds; containers use the
  ASGI entrypoint behind a reverse proxy. See `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- **Prometheus metrics** — `/metrics` content-negotiates between JSON and Prometheus text, with
  latency histograms and per-refusal-reason counters.
- **Optional Postgres store** (`portmark[postgres]`) behind the existing `RuntimeStore` protocol,
  with contract tests run against both backends in CI.
- **`THREAT_MODEL.md`** — trust boundaries, attacker capabilities, abuse paths, and residual risks.
- Packaging metadata: long description, project URLs, classifiers and keywords. The `0.1.0` page
  carried none of these.

### Changed

- **A2A boundary moved to ASGI/uvicorn** from `ThreadingHTTPServer`. Admission control now wraps
  the body read, so a rate-limited request is refused before its body is buffered.
- **Agent Card is now conformant to the canonical `a2a.proto`** and byte-identical to the official
  SDK's, asserted by a test. Six fields that a strict client rejected were removed or restructured.
- Request validation is deliberately **stricter than the official SDK** — it rejects missing
  `messageId`, missing `role`, and empty `parts`, which proto3 cannot distinguish from defaults.
- CI runs one matrix per push instead of two, and the concurrency test now has margin between
  offered load and the server cap.

### Fixed

- **`--trust-registry-path` was silently ignored** whenever no operator private key was set: the
  loaded registry was discarded and replaced with a fresh one, so an explicitly configured trust
  anchor did nothing.
- Registering a signer's own key now **fails closed** when the registry already holds that key id
  with a different public key, instead of producing signatures that verify nowhere.
- `verify-audit` distinguishes `valid` / `invalid` / `unverifiable` with exit codes 0 / 1 / 2,
  rather than conflating a forged chain with missing configuration.

### Security

- Fail-closed guard coverage in `security.py` raised from 82% to **98%**, with the count of
  security guards that no test exercises reduced from 62 to 2 — both remaining ones are input-type
  validation, not security decisions. Verified by tampering: neutering a guard turns exactly the
  test that names it red.
- 144 regression tests, green on Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13.
